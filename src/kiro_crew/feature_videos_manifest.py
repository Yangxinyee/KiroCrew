"""The signed catalog of hosted feature-video clips, and the gate over fetching it.

:mod:`kiro_crew.feature_videos` ships a static catalog compiled into the package.
That is the right shape for two clips, and the wrong one for a growing library:
every added video would need a release, and the media would have to ride in the
wheel. This module is the hosted half — a manifest published per release folder on
the CDN, listing the clips available for that release with a sha256 for each.

Three properties make it safe to act on bytes fetched from a CDN:

**The manifest is signed, and an unverified manifest is discarded WHOLE.** Not
"the bad entries are dropped" — the document is refused, because the signature
covers the document. It is verified against the same offline key ``cli.sh`` pins
for the update feed (:mod:`kiro_crew.platform.feed_trust`), under a distinct
``schema`` string so a manifest of one kind can never be replayed as the other.
The fail-safe direction is "no manifest": the static catalog still serves, and
nothing is downloaded.

**Every clip is sha256-pinned by the signed manifest, so the CDN is not trusted.**
A tampered object can only fail verification in
:mod:`kiro_crew.asset_downloader`; it cannot reach the cache directory.

**The browser never fetches from the CDN.** Only this gateway does — through
:mod:`kiro_crew.asset_downloader`, which verifies TLS, refuses cross-origin
redirects and checks the sha256 before a file is installed. An entry that is not
on disk yet is simply not offered; what the dashboard plays is always a
same-origin file whose bytes were verified here first.

Fetching any of this is governed by ``capabilities.feature_videos_download``
(fail-closed). A denied ceiling means no manifest request and no clip download:
only what is already on disk is offered.

#: and a hanging CDN must not hold the task open for the download timeout.
_MANIFEST_TIMEOUT_SECS = 10

#: Signed-payload cap, passed to the shared verifier. The CLI feed's own cap
#: stays what it was — a manifest of clips is a larger document than a channel
#: descriptor and needs its own bound. The value is the PUBLISHER's
#: ``DEFAULT_MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES``: a cap tighter than the one a release is built
#: against would discard a valid manifest, and the discard is whole-document, so
#: the failure would be "no videos" rather than "one clip missing".
_SIGNED_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES = 256 * 1024

#: Per-clip size ceiling. A feature intro is a ~20 second screen recording; a
#: manifest asking for more than this is either wrong or hostile, and the

_MAX_ENTRY_BYTES = 64 * 1024 * 1024

#: Cap on how many entries one manifest may carry — a cheap coherence check, not the
#: real one. :data:`_SIGNED_PAYLOAD_MAX_BYTES` is what actually limits a manifest,
#: and this sits far enough above it that a document the publisher would emit
#: cannot trip this instead: tripping it discards the whole manifest, and "we
#: refused a valid release because it listed too many clips" is not a failure
#: worth having.
_MAX_ENTRIES = 1000

#: A media basename: no directory component, no traversal, no escaping. An
#: allowlist rather than a denylist, because this string becomes a path segment
#: on disk AND a URL segment the browser fetches — the two decodings do not
#: agree, so enumerating what is forbidden is the losing side of that.

#: each component bounded.
#:
#: One to four components, because the publisher accepts a bare numeric version of
#: any depth (``scripts/feature-videos/_manifest.py``, in the publishing tool that
#: ships separately) while Kiro Crew's own
#: releases are always ``major.minor.patch``. Accepting what the publisher can emit
#: costs nothing — the fetch path only ever ASKS for ``major.minor.patch`` folders
#: (:func:`release_candidates`) — and refusing it would discard a valid release

    folder it was served from — a manifest that disagrees with its own location
    is refused, so a stale or misfiled document cannot silently redirect one
    release's clips into another release's folder.

    the candidate folders, so a document declaring a release outside that window

    would show no clips on an offline restart despite the bytes being on disk.
    Refusing it here, with the reason logged, is the honest failure.

    requests, and a withdrawal landing between two of them must stop the next
    one rather than ride the permit the first was made on — the same rule the
    download pass applies between a poster and its clip. The caller's own check
    before scheduling the pass still stands; it is what keeps a denied install
